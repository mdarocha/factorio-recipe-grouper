# Factorio Recipe Grouper

This tool allows you to group Factorio recipes by their inputs. It may be helpful sometimes when designing factory sectiond.
It uses recipe data from [factoriolab](https://github.com/factoriolab/factoriolab).

## Getting started

Ensure you have Deno installed. If not, you can install it from here.

### Running the Project

Clone this repositor and mavigate into the project directory.

Start the dev server:

```bash

This will overwrite the files in the `./src` directory with versions that are ready for static hosting.
